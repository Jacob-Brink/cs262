# CS 262 - Lab 2

This lab is based on [Calvin University CS 262 Lab 2](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/02management/lab.html)

Some hacks I had to make was using useEffect to update the array of birthdays based on the state of age.

Answers to the lab questions:
* The name of the component is App.
* One prop is the "onPress" for the button and one state is "brithdays".
* Curly braces are used to denote javascript code in otherwise normal text.
* One anonymous function is the lambda function that calls the addBirthday function.
* No, react native compiles to native application code.
