I used ESlint for FloatingView.js file, and although many of the suggestions were great, such as forcing single quotes over double quotes and removing unused variables, I found that some of the suggestions were not applicable or did not appeal to me. One such suggestion is to have no space between the curly space and the variable. For example, the line with "import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';" should be "import {StyleSheet, View, Text} from 'react-native';" according to them. To me, this is gross. So I didn't do it. It also told me to have my props validated, but I intend to have all components assume that the parents take care of having the props be defined.
